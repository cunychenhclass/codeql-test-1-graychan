# CodeQL Tests

For GitHub to accept uploads of CodeQL scan results, we have to enable "Avanced
CodeQL Analysis" for the repository. 

- Problem. Unfortunatley, we can only do so for those with Enterprise subscripts or for
public repositories.
- Nice Feature. Once the Avanced CodeQL Analysis is enabled, the entire
	pipeline of code scanning and uploading results can be automated by
	GitHub workflow.
